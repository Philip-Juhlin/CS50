# CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science

## About This Repo

This repository contains my solutions and projects from Harvard's CS50 course.

While I have hands-on experience building real-world tools in **Python** and **C#**—including CLI applications, custom modules, API endpoints, and integrations with Odoo and SampleManager 12.2—I'm taking CS50 to deepen my foundational understanding of computer science concepts and improve my programming skills in a structured way.

The course helps me strengthen my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques that complement my practical experience and prepare me for more complex software development challenges.

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a CS50 week or problem set.
- Code is written primarily in C and Python.
- README files within folders describe each assignment or project.

## What I’m Learning

- Algorithms and data structures
- Memory management and pointers
- Web development basics
- Security fundamentals
- More robust coding and debugging practices
